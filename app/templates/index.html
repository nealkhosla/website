		<h4>About Me</h4>
		<p>I am currently a student at Stanford University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I chose to study computer science because it allows me to <a href="/projects">build things</a>. I find this to be incredibly empowering and recently have started to apply my computer science skills to enable myself to further pursue my two main passions: sports and data. As a sports fan, I'm a diehard fan of the San Francisco Giants and 49ers, the Stanford Cardinal, and the Golden State Warriors. I also follow the San Jose Sharks pretty closely but I'll avoid calling myself a diehard to avoid the ire of my sister. Throughout my life I've used sports to further my academic pursuits and recently I've started to work on ways to push the envelope <a href="/sports_projects">analytics in sports</a>. As a result of this, I have worked with a couple of NBA teams on their analytics and interned with the San Francisco 49ers helping them quantify ways to value picks in NFL Draft. In the past few years, I've developed a new passion for data in general and am fascinated by the potential of things like Predictive Analytics, Machine Learning, and in particular, Deep Learning, to enhance the lives of people worldwide. Though I still have a lot to learn in these areas, I continue to push myself to take on new projects in these areas.</p>

		<p>Over the past few years, I've taken on work at <a href="http://www.jawbone.com">Jawbone</a> and <a href="http://www.ayasdi.com">Ayasdi</a> as a data science intern, and at the <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu">Stanford GSB</a> doing research with Professor George Foster on television ratings for Regional Sports Networks (paper pending publication). Over the past year, I've also been involved with <a href=http://www.dormroomfund.com/">Dorm Room Fund</a>, a student run investment team. </p>
